## Introduction

Certifications and training are critical foundations to your personal career in cloud engineering and also for an organisation's cloud adoption journey. 

This section covers some of the areas which you should consider when addressing the requirements for these scenarios.

### Start and Keep Learning
Above all, this is the most important point to consider before even starting to look at which certification track to take, or which development language to learn. Technology is advancing each year at an incredible pace, so it's important that we each develop a culture of remaining curious and always realising that we can't know everything.

Alongside this, you should realise that everyone should apply the knowledge you learn, build and fix things and always go back and review work you've done in the past. Simply passing a certification is only part of the challenge; if you're not able to apply experience to the situation and know more than is required to simply pass an exam, then you'll really struggle when architecting future products and solutions.

 - Sign up to online training with a personal account or through your organisation's training provider.
 - Create your own accounts in one or more cloud providers to test out what you've learned or build a proof of concept for a new idea.
 - Use learning providers like A Cloud Guru who provide built in sandbox access for accessing a cloud platform without the risk of running up accidental bills.

### Training Structure

Each cloud provider has their own certification tracks, but this table helps to break down each level and link it with a suggested role:

| Suggested Job Roles | Amazon Web Services | Microsoft Azure | Google Cloud Platform
|--|--|--|--|
|Junior Developer, Executive Leader, Finance Head, Procurement Head, Technology Head, Security Head| AWS Cloud Practitioner|AZ-100 Azure Fundamental|Cloud Digital Leader
|Developers, Cloud Leaders, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), Cloud Engineers, IT Operations Teams, Information Security Analysts, Database Administrators|AWS Solution Architect Associate|AZ-104 Azure Administration|Cloud Engineer|
|Senior Developers, Senior Cloud Engineers|AWS Solution Architect Professional|Azure Solutions Architect|Cloud Architect|

Each cloud provider has specialist training and certification tracks for SME roles such as development, database administration, security and others which can be taken alongside the generalist tracks detailed above.
