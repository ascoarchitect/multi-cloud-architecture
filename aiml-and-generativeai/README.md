## What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
Draft
* AI that can produce original content close enough to human generated content for real-world tasks
* Powered by foundation models pre-trained on large sets of data with several hundred billion parameters
* Tasks can be customised for specific domains with minimal fine-tuning
* Applicable to many use cases like text summarisation, question answering, digital art creation, code generation, etc.
* Reduces time and cost to develop ML models and innovate faster

Examples of where GenAI can be used:

* Text generation
* Chatbot/Virtual Assistant
* Text extraction and summarisation
* Search
* Code generation
* Image generation
* Image classification
* Music creation
* Video creation
