# FinOps

## Introduction

FinOps has always been an important foundation to deploying workloads into the cloud, however, with more organisations trying to derive better value from their cloud solutions this has now become a key focus. The Linux Foundation established a FinOps framework which addresses all of the cultural and process-based changes which need to be incorporated to ensure that it becomes part of your cloud DNA rather than a report which sits on a dashboard.

This resource will look to summarise some of the key components, but does not replace the need for more people becoming certified FinOps practitioners. You can find out more about the training and certification in the further reading section below.

## Common Misconceptions

FinOps is not about having the cheapest possible cloud bill.

Cheaper is not necessarily better.

One of the key messages that needs to be driven within an organisation is that FinOps is not about making everything cheaper and purchasing a huge number of reserved instances, committing to 1 or 3 year usage. Instead, it's about understanding the value that a service provides to the business, which could be the sale of a product or the generation of a lead for example. If a solution costs £80k per month to run in the cloud, but generates £400k of net new revenue for the organisation, then it's a fantastic investment. This could be defined as a value-based KPI in the form of a ratio where a minimum ratio of 1.5:1 revenue vs cost is positive but less is negative. In the example above, this would be a ratio of 5:1 which is positive.

The specific KPIs used are part of the discovery and deliverables that make up FinOps, but this demonstrates that when you just look at cloud as a cost rather than an enabler, you miss out the point of the exercise. Failing to grasp this could result in cost savings being made, but then leading to revenue impacts.

*"Unit economics and value-based metrics demonstrate business impact better than aggregate spend. Think of cloud as a driver of innovation, a driver of capability, and a way to get speed to market and customer satisfaction up."*

### Principles

* Teams need to collaborate
* Decisions are driven by the business value of cloud
* Everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage
* FinOps reports should be accessible and timely
* A centralised team drives FinOps
* Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud
