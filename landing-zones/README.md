# Cloud Adoption and Landing Zones

## Introduction

A Landing Zone (LZ) forms the foundation of your cloud platform and centrally provides networking, account vending, security, logging and guardrail capabilities for all accounts within your organisation. Without an LZ deployed, there will be an administrative overhead for your cloud and technology teams as they will likely need to configure the settings and access in each individual account which is created.

AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud each have their own design for an LZ on their platforms, but importantly they all have the deployment of this capability as part of their Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).

> The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) leverages AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate your business outcomes through innovative use of AWS. AWS CAF identifies specific organisational capabilities that underpin successful cloud transformations. These capabilities provide best practice guidance that helps you improve your cloud readiness.
> 
> AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. Each perspective comprises a set of capabilities that functionally related stakeholders own or manage in the cloud transformation journey. Use the AWS CAF to identify and prioritise transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve your cloud readiness, and iteratively evolve your transformation roadmap.

The AWS CAF provides a clear roadmap for cloud adoption within your organisation and places a heavy focus on the need to adapt your culture to take full advantage of the cloud. The need to adapt processes and invest in training cannot be understated

## Further Reading

#### [Reaching Cloud Velocity: A Leader's Guide to Success in the AWS Cloud](https://amzn.to/3QqW36D)

Reaching Cloud Velocity provides leadership best practices covering the most requested customer topics. Whilst there is a heavy focus on services which are provided on the AWS Cloud, there are cloud agnostic approaches that are shared in this book which can be applied to any cloud platform.

* How enterprises are transforming with AWS
* Aligning business and technology strategy to benefit from cloud
* Re-skilling and scaling your cloud fluency
* Setting the right culture and organization model to attract and retain engineering talent
* How to migrate data centres to AWS while holistically benefitting from the improved availability, security, and governance it can offer.

The book also goes deeper into how leaders can leverage the inherent reliability and durability of the AWS Cloud, and how compute, containers, serverless, APIs, microservices, database, analytics, and machine learning have evolved into a set of highly resilient, secure, and scalable building blocks - allowing builders to innovate at a fraction of the costs they would have typically come to expect.
